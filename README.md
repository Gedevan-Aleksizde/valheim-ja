https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1511/

## Installation

1. Download the latest `resources.assets` file from [Release page](https://github.com/Gedevan-Aleksizde/valheim-ja/releases)
2. Overwrite the file with the downloaded one in  `valheim_Data` in your Valheim installed directory.

## Changelog

* v0.3.1 (Update for v0.203.11)
    * some linebreaks added to avoid display text as very small size
    * some subtle correction to improve the immersion

## Dependencies

If you want to edit the text on your own, you need the following programs:

* [UABE](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE) or [UAAE](https://github.com/Igor55x/UAAE)
* Python >3.8
* pandas

## Note

* [dict/](dict/) contains retranslated text as json
* [terms.json](terms.json) is not refered by any Python scripts. It's just my personal memo so as to translate text consistenytly.
